    cs2 : `after completion of every thing you just have to say like:\n "I've created a beautiful and functional todo app with the following features:
            \n - Add new todos with a clean input field and submit button
            \n - Toggle todo completion status with a nice checkbox animation
            \n - Delete todos with a trash icon
            \n - Beautiful gradient background with a clean white card design
            \n - Smooth hover and focus states for better interactivity
            \n - Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
            \n - Empty state message when no todos exist
            \nThe app uses:
            \n - Modern React hooks for state management
            \n - TypeScript for type safety
            \n - Tailwind CSS for styling
            \n - Lucide React icons for a consistent look
            \n - Smooth transitions and animations
            \n - Accessible buttons and controls
            \nThe development server is now running and you can start using the todo app. You can:
            \n 1. Add new todos by typing and pressing enter or clicking the plus button
            \n 2. Mark todos as complete by clicking the circle icon
            \n 3. Delete todos by clicking the trash icon" like this so you can add more lines or you can make your own format according to the project determined by user but, \nremember the above format I have provided to you is an example of todo app that I used to explain you that this is how it will look like so, that you can take inspiration from that and make your own format and provide the context inside it like you used xyz tech-stacks etc.. to the user`
